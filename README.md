# scalar_replacement_of_aggregates

Implementing complex type disaggregation in the High Level Synthesis (HLS) context. The work is provided under the form of LLVM transform pass performing a first phase of function versioning followed by the actual expansion of aggregate types. The last phase performs code cleanup_ and different other correlated optimizations. Several constructors are provided in order to spread those phases in the chain and interleave other optimizations. Overall, this transformation allows predicate instruction execution and enables further HLS optimizations. In detail, aggregate types such as structs and arrays are disaggregated and any memory operation accessing them is modified accordingly. In case of non constant accesses, predicate instruction execution is exploited.
